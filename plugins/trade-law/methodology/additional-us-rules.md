# Additional U.S. Rules of Interpretation

## Overview

In addition to the six General Rules of Interpretation (GRI), the HTSUS contains Additional U.S. Rules of Interpretation that apply specifically to U.S. tariff classification. These rules supplement (but do not override) the GRIs.

Authority: General Note 3(b), HTSUS.

## Additional U.S. Rule 1(a): Tariff Rate Provisions

**Rule:** A tariff classification controlled by use (other than actual use) is to be determined in accordance with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods belong, and the controlling use is the **principal use**.

**Application:**
- When a heading or subheading is defined by use (e.g., "for use with automatic data processing machines"), the relevant inquiry is the **principal use** of goods of that *class or kind*.
- This is a *class or kind* test, not an inquiry into the actual use of the specific imported article.
- Factors for determining class or kind (from *Primal Lites* and *Carborundum*):
  1. General physical characteristics
  2. Expectation of the ultimate purchasers
  3. Channels of trade
  4. Environment of sale (where the goods are sold)
  5. Use in the same manner as merchandise that already fits the heading
  6. Economic practicality of the use

**Example:** A power supply "for use with ADP machines" is classified based on whether power supplies of that class or kind are principally used with ADP machines — not whether this specific unit will be.

**Doctrinal Application:** For the full Carborundum factors applied as
doctrine — including how to define "class or kind," the evidence hierarchy,
and the interaction between principal use and essential character — see
`methodology/essential-character-doctrine.md` Section 2.

## Additional U.S. Rule 1(b): Actual Use Provisions

**Rule:** A tariff classification controlled by the actual use to which the imported goods are put in the United States is satisfied only if:
1. Such use is intended at the time of importation
2. The goods are so used
3. Proof thereof is furnished within 3 years after the date the goods are entered

**Application:**
- Applies to provisions that explicitly require "actual use" (e.g., certain agricultural products for seed).
- The importer must prove the goods were actually put to the required use within 3 years.
- Failure to provide proof may result in reclassification at a higher duty rate.

## Additional U.S. Rule 1(c): Parts and Accessories

**Rule:** A provision for parts of an article covers products solely or principally used as a part of such article, but a provision for "parts" or "parts and accessories" shall not prevail over a specific provision for such part or accessory.

**Application:**
1. When a subheading covers "parts" of an article, the product must be **solely or principally used** as a part of that article.
2. However, if there is a **more specific provision** for the part itself elsewhere in the tariff, the specific provision prevails.
   - Example: A ball bearing (heading 8482) used in a pump would be classified under 8482 (specific provision for bearings), not under the "parts of pumps" provision in heading 8413.
3. This rule interacts with Section XVI Notes 2 and 3 (parts of Chapter 84/85 machines).

## Additional U.S. Rule 1(d): Textile Classification

**Rule:** Where a tariff rate is determined by the weight of the textile component, such rate applies to the entire article (not just the textile component), unless the context requires otherwise.

---

## Interaction with GRIs

The Additional U.S. Rules operate **within** the GRI framework:

```
Step 1: Apply GRI 1-5 to determine the 4-digit heading
Step 2: Apply GRI 6 for subheading determination
Step 3: Within GRI 6, apply Additional U.S. Rules where relevant
         (principal use, actual use, parts provisions)
Step 4: U.S. statistical suffix (10-digit) is the final determination
```

The Additional U.S. Rules are particularly relevant at the **subheading and statistical suffix level**, where HTSUS-specific provisions diverge from the international Harmonized System.

## Common Application Scenarios

| Scenario | Rule | Analysis |
|----------|------|----------|
| "For use with" a machine | 1(a) Principal Use | Apply class-or-kind principal use test |
| "Of a kind used for" a purpose | 1(a) Principal Use | Same class-or-kind analysis |
| "Fit for human consumption" | 1(a) Principal Use | Based on objective characteristics of the class |
| "For sowing" (seeds) | 1(b) Actual Use | Importer must prove seeds were actually planted |
| "Parts of [machine]" | 1(c) Parts | Solely/principally used as part; specific provision prevails |
| Textile weight-based rate | 1(d) Textile | Rate applies to entire article |
