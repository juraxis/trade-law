# Essential Character & Principal Use Doctrinal Frameworks

**Case Attribution Rule:** Do not quote or attribute a specific holding
to a case unless the opinion text (or a reliable secondary source such
as Justia, Google Scholar, or a court website) was retrieved in-session.
If the case was NOT retrieved, describe the doctrine generically and
label case mentions as "commonly cited for [principle]" rather than
asserting exact holdings or quoting language.

## Section 1: Essential Character — GRI 3(b)

GRI 3(b) applies when a product is prima facie classifiable under two or more headings and GRI 3(a) (most specific description) does not resolve the classification. Essential character determines which material or component gives a composite good, mixture, or retail set its defining identity.

### Multi-Factor Framework

Evaluate **all** of the following factors (from CIT/CAFC case law and EN guidance):

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Nature of material/component** | What is the material or component made of? What is its character? |
| **Bulk/weight** | Which component constitutes the greatest physical mass? |
| **Value** | Which component represents the greatest share of cost or value? |
| **Role in use** | Which component makes the product what it is? Which component is essential to the product's function? |
| **Consumer expectation** | What would a purchaser consider the defining element? What drives the purchase decision? |

### Case Law on Factor Weighting

- ***Riddell, Inc. v. United States*** (CAFC 2007) — commonly cited for the principle that the component giving an article its identity and purpose in use determines essential character, even when not the heaviest or most expensive component. **Takeaway:** Role in use is a strong tiebreaker when factors conflict.

- ***Conair Corp. v. United States*** (CIT 2005) — commonly cited for the principle that no single factor is automatically dispositive; courts look for reasoned analysis documenting all factors and explaining the weighting. **Takeaway:** Document every factor and explain why you weighted them as you did. Conclusory assertions that one factor "prevails" are insufficient.

- ***Primal Lites v. United States*** (CIT 1991) — commonly cited for the retail sets essential character test. **Three conditions for a retail set under GRI 3(b):**
  1. Two or more articles classifiable in different headings
  2. Put up together for retail sale
  3. Satisfy a particular need or carry out a specific activity

### Resolving Factor Conflicts

- **Value highest but role minor** → Role in use may still prevail (*Riddell* principle). The component that gives the article its identity controls, even if another component is more expensive.
- **All factors align** → Strong conclusion. State the alignment explicitly.
- **Factors genuinely split** → Flag for attorney review per `reference/human-review-triggers.md`. Document the split honestly rather than artificially forcing a conclusion. State which factors support which heading.

### Burden of Proof

The importer bears the burden of proving essential character when challenging CBP's classification.

- If the essential character analysis is **genuinely ambiguous**, the importer's position is harder to sustain because the burden falls on the challenger.
- Document which party's position the factor analysis supports.
- If the analysis supports the importer's position, state the supporting factors clearly. If it supports CBP's likely position, note that challenging this classification would require overcoming the presumption of correctness.

## Section 2: Principal Use — Additional U.S. Rule 1(a)

Principal use analysis applies when a heading or subheading is defined by use (e.g., "for use with," "of a kind used for"). The controlling use is the **principal use of the class or kind** — not the actual use of the specific import.

### Carborundum Factors

*United States v. Carborundum Co.* (CCPA 1976) is commonly cited for establishing the six-factor test that is the standard framework for determining principal use:

| # | Factor | Evidence Sources |
|---|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **General physical characteristics** | Product specifications, materials, dimensions, design features |
| 2 | **Expectation of ultimate purchasers** | Marketing materials, customer surveys, industry reports |
| 3 | **Channels of trade** | Where the product is sold (retail, wholesale, specialty, industrial) |
| 4 | **Environment of sale** | How the product is displayed, described, and marketed at point of sale |
| 5 | **Use in same manner as merchandise already fitting the provision** | CROSS rulings classifying similar products, CBP practice |
| 6 | **Economic practicality of the use** | Is the stated use economically viable? Cost-benefit of the use |

### How to Apply

1. **Identify the provision's use language** — note the exact wording ("for use with," "of a kind used for," "suitable for").
2. **Define the "class or kind"** — the commercial category of goods, NOT this specific import. Ask: what is the recognized commercial class to which this product belongs?
3. **Apply each Carborundum factor** to the class or kind — gather evidence for each factor.
4. **Principal use of the class controls** — even if this specific import will be used differently. If the class or kind is principally used for the stated purpose, the product is classified under the use-based provision regardless of the importer's intended use.

### Evidence Hierarchy for Principal Use

1. **CROSS rulings** classifying the same class or kind of goods
2. **Industry data** — trade association reports, import statistics by end use
3. **Marketing materials** — how the class is marketed and sold
4. **Physical characteristics** — design features indicating intended use
5. **Expert declarations** — industry experts on principal use of the class

### Interaction with Essential Character

**These are distinct tests at different analytical stages:**

| Test | When Applied | Question Answered |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Essential character (GRI 3(b))** | Heading level — when a composite/mixed good fits multiple headings | Which component defines this composite good? |
| **Principal use (Rule 1(a))** | Subheading level — when a subheading uses use-based language | Which use defines the class of goods for this provision? |

**Sequence:** Apply GRI 3(a)/(b) at the heading level first to determine the 4-digit heading. Then, if the subheading within that heading is use-based, apply principal use analysis at the subheading level. Do not conflate the two tests.
