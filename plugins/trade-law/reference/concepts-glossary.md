# Concepts Glossary - Terminology Anchors

This glossary is a guardrail. It exists to reduce terminology drift and prevent unnecessary WTO-law commentary in entry-level customs work product.

Use it to define commonly confused terms, and to clarify what NOT to do in this skill.

## MFN vs. NTR (Column 1 General)

Preferred term in this skill: `Column 1 General (MFN/NTR)` (or simply `Column 1 General` in tables).

Definition: The HTSUS Column 1 General rate is the standard tariff rate applied to imports from countries that receive Normal Trade Relations treatment. The term "MFN" is often used colloquially to refer to the same non-discriminatory baseline rate concept in trade policy contexts.

Do NOT:
- Label a duty table line as "WTO MFN rate." Use `Column 1 General` as the rate label.
- Suggest that WTO concepts determine the payable rate for a specific entry. In this skill, payable rates are determined from HTSUS (including Chapter 99 where applicable) and other applicable U.S. measures.

## WTO vs. WCO

Preferred usage in this skill: WCO is routinely relevant; WTO is rarely relevant for entry-level memos.

Definition:
- WTO (World Trade Organization): trade rules, tariff bindings, dispute settlement, and trade policy commitments.
- WCO (World Customs Organization): maintains the Harmonized System (HS) nomenclature and publishes Explanatory Notes used as persuasive classification guidance.

Do NOT:
- Attribute HS Explanatory Notes to the WTO.
- Cite WTO materials as controlling authority for an HTSUS classification.

---

## HS vs. HTSUS

Preferred usage in this skill: Use and cite HTSUS for U.S. import classification; use HS only when discussing the international 6-digit level or WCO Explanatory Notes.

Definition:
- HS: international Harmonized System. The first 6 digits are harmonized globally.
- HTSUS: U.S. implementation of the HS. Digits 7-8 are U.S. legal subheadings; digits 9-10 are statistical reporting suffixes.

Do NOT:
- Present a 6-digit HS code as a final U.S. tariff classification.
- Conflate the 10-digit HTSUS statistical suffix with the HS.

---

## Bound vs. Applied Rates

Preferred usage in this skill: Report the applied rate (what is actually collected) for the entry; mention bound rates only if the user explicitly asks or the task is policy-level.

Definition:
- Bound rate: a WTO ceiling commitment in a member's tariff schedule.
- Applied rate: the rate actually collected at the border (e.g., HTSUS Column 1 General, plus applicable additional duties/fees).

Do NOT:
- Treat bound rates as the payable duty rate for an entry.
- Add bound-rate discussion to routine duty calculations.

---

## Rules of Origin vs. Country of Origin

Preferred usage in this skill: Always state origin by purpose (marking vs. FTA vs. TAA vs. Section 301 applicability) and the rule set used.

Definition:
- Country of origin: the conclusion (which country is the origin) for a specific legal purpose.
- Rules of origin: the legal criteria used to reach that conclusion.

Common U.S. origin rule sets in this skill:
- Marking origin: 19 CFR Part 134 (and, where applicable, special rules such as 19 CFR Part 102).
- FTA origin: agreement-specific rules (tariff shift, RVC, etc.).
- TAA origin: substantial transformation plus designated-country requirement for procurement contexts.

Do NOT:
- Assume one origin conclusion controls all legal purposes.
- Treat consumer "Made in ___" marketing claims as determinative for tariff origin.

---

## Trade Remedies (Sections 301 / 232 / 201)

Preferred usage in this skill: Treat these as U.S. domestic measures implemented through HTSUS Chapter 99 and related U.S. authorities; verify current status.

Definition:
- Section 301: Trade Act measures (commonly China-focused additional duties).
- Section 232: national security measures (commonly steel/aluminum and derivatives).
- Section 201: safeguard measures (product-focused, often with TRQ structures).

Do NOT:
- Opine on WTO legality, WTO dispute outcomes, or retaliation risk in entry-level classification/duty memos unless the user explicitly asks or the task is policy-level analysis.
