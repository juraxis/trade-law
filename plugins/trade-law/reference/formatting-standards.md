- Heading-level reference: `heading 8471, HTSUS`
- Chapter reference: `Chapter 84, HTSUS`
- With rate: `8471.60.1080, HTSUS (General: Free)`
- Always include "HTSUS" on first reference; may abbreviate thereafter

### CROSS Ruling Citations
- Format: `CBP Ruling [NY/HQ] [Number] (dated [Month Day, Year])`
- Examples:

## Authority Hierarchy Notation

When multiple authorities conflict, present in descending order of weight:

```
HTSUS legal text (heading terms, section notes, chapter notes, Additional U.S. Rules, GRIs)
  — the statute is the primary authority; everything below interprets and applies it

  > CAFC decisions (binding interpretation; controlling on CIT and CBP)
    > CIT decisions (binding on the parties and entries at issue;
      strong persuasive authority; CBP generally conforms absent contrary CAFC)
      > HQ rulings (Headquarters — national scope, complex matters)
        > NY rulings (New York — routine, port-level classifications)
          > Informed Compliance Publications (CBP guidance, not binding)
            > Trade articles and commentary (informational only)
```

The HTSUS text and GRIs are the law. Courts and CBP interpret and apply that law. A judicial decision does not override the statute — it interprets it. When a decision appears to conflict with heading text, the decision is construing the statutory language in light of the specific facts.

Always note when a lower authority conflicts with a higher one.
