### 4. Duty Calculation Example

If the customs value is known or estimated:

```
Customs Value (Transaction Value):    ${amount}

Column 1 General:  {rate}% × ${value} = ${amount}
Section 301:       {rate}% × ${value} = ${amount}
Section 232:       {rate}% × ${value} = ${amount}
AD Duty:           {rate}% × ${value} = ${amount}
CVD:               {rate}% × ${value} = ${amount}
                                        ──────────
TOTAL ESTIMATED DUTY:                   ${total}
Effective Rate:                         {total/value}%

Fees (not included in duty total):
MPF:               {rate (verify)}% × ${value} = ${amount} (min/max per entry applies)
HMF:               {rate (verify)}% × ${value} = ${amount} (ocean shipments only)
```

If the customs value is not known: "Duty calculation requires the customs value (transaction value). Provide the commercial invoice value for a dollar-amount estimate."
